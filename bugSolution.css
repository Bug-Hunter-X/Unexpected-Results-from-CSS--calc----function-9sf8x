The solution involves ensuring consistent units within the `calc()` function. If the calculation involves multiple operations, use parentheses to control the order of operations:

```css
/* Incorrect: Inconsistent units */
width: calc(100% - 50); /* 50 what? pixels? */

/* Correct: Consistent units */
width: calc(100% - 50px);

/* Incorrect: Order of operations */
width: calc(100% - 50px + 20%);

/* Correct: Order of operations using parenthesis */
width: calc(100% - (50px + 20%));
```
This ensures accurate and predictable calculations within the `calc()` function.
